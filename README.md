Team Lead: Rachel Sagers

Coders: Mengke Du, Nicole Hood, Mehar Anand

## Project Organization

### Data

The course engagement data used in project analyses is stored in the 'data' directory. To save as a data frame in RStudio, coders should use the read.csv() function.

### Code

New code files for each analysis should be stored in the 'code' directory.

### Output

Figures and tables generated by the code should be saved in the 'output' directory. Any .rds objects will be not be stored on the remote repository as specified by the .gitignore file.

## Analysis Components

1. Time trends of video engagement over weeks of class

2. Model for predicting engagement based on topic, video number, and length

3. Visualization of total length of all videos for each topic

## Final Report

The final report can be rendered by running the make command, which will execute the Makefile. The Makefile specifies rules for creating report elements and rendering the final report.
